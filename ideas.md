  **Design Movement**: **Art Deco Revival / Modern Luxury**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Opulence & Exclusivity**: Every interaction should feel like entering a VIP lounge.
  2.  **Precision & Geometry**: Clean lines, symmetrical layouts, and structured content.
  3.  **Cinematic Presentation**: Large, high-quality imagery that tells a story of travel and comfort.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Midnight Black (#050505)**: The canvas, representing depth and infinite possibility.
  -   **Champagne Gold (#D4AF37)**: The accent, symbolizing wealth, prestige, and warmth. Used for buttons, borders, and key typography.
  -   **Charcoal Grey (#1A1A1A)**: For secondary backgrounds to create subtle depth without breaking the dark theme.
  
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Asymmetric Editorial**: Move away from standard centered hero sections. Use split-screen layouts where text and imagery overlap slightly to create depth.
  -   **Vertical Rhythm**: Strong vertical lines and spacing to guide the eye down the page elegantly.
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Gold Borders & Dividers**: Thin, elegant gold lines separating sections.
  -   **Parallax Scrolling**: Subtle movement of background images to create immersion.
  -   **Glassmorphism**: Dark, frosted glass effects for cards and navigation to maintain context while adding layer depth.
  
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Slow & Smooth**: Hover effects should be slow-ease transitions, not snappy. Buttons should glow rather than just change color.
  -   **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: Elements should fade and slide in gently as the user scrolls.
  
  **Animation**:
  -   **Fade-Up**: Text and images float up with a soft fade.
  -   **Gold Shimmer**: A subtle sheen effect on the gold buttons or logo on hover.
  
  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: *Playfair Display* (Serif) - Elegant, classic, and authoritative.
  -   **Body**: *Montserrat* (Sans-serif) - Modern, geometric, and highly readable.
  -   **Accents**: *Cormorant Garamond* (Serif) - For italicized testimonials or quotes.

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism Luxury**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Bold & Unapologetic**: Large typography, high contrast, and confident spacing.
  2.  **Raw Materiality**: Textures that mimic leather, metal, or marble.
  3.  **Function First**: Information is presented clearly without unnecessary decoration, but with high-end finishing.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Deep Navy (#0A192F)**: A sophisticated alternative to black, suggesting trust and professionalism.
  -   **Burnished Copper (#B87333)**: A warmer, more industrial luxury accent than standard gold.
  -   **Alabaster White (#F0F0F0)**: For text, providing sharp contrast.
  
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Grid-Based Modular**: distinct blocks of content separated by thick lines.
  -   **Oversized Typography**: Headings that span the full width of the container.
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Monogram Patterns**: Using the "CT" logo as a subtle background pattern.
  -   **Sharp Corners**: No rounded corners; everything is precise and sharp.
  
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons feel like physical switches.
  -   **Instant Response**: Interactions are immediate and snappy.
  
  **Animation**:
  -   **Slide & Reveal**: Content slides out from behind masks.
  -   **Typewriter Effect**: For key value propositions.
  
  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: *Bodoni Moda* (Didone) - High contrast, fashion-forward.
  -   **Body**: *Space Grotesk* (Sans-serif) - Technical and modern.

  **Design Movement**: **Ethereal Minimalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Weightlessness**: The interface should feel light and airy, even with a dark theme.
  2.  **Focus on Imagery**: The vehicles and destinations are the heroes; the UI recedes.
  3.  **Softness**: Gentle curves, soft shadows, and diffused light.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:

  -   **Soft Cream (#F5E6D3)**: For text and light accents.
  -   **Muted Gold (#C5A059)**: Less metallic, more organic gold tone.
  
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Floating Cards**: Content floats above the background with deep, soft shadows.
  -   **Central Axis**: A strong central alignment for a classic, balanced feel.
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Circular Masks**: Images cropped in circles or ovals.
  -   **Gradient Overlays**: Soft gradients to blend images into the background.
  
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Fluidity**: Everything flows like liquid.
  -   **Magnetic Elements**: Buttons slightly attract the cursor.
  
  **Animation**:
  -   **Blur-In**: Elements blur into focus.
  -   **Continuous Float**: Subtle floating animation for hero images.
  
  **Typography System**:
